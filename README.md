# JuniperSample
Sample Tax calculator app demonstrating a basic Xamarin Forms app that uses MVVM and dependancy injection.

NOTE: One thing I noticed when viewing some of the source code in GitHub some files seem to have weird formatting issue where some of the brackets are not aligned. I re-pulled the code down and opned in Visual Studio and everything looked good. I just wanted you to be aware if you see that I did NOT do that in my code. :)
